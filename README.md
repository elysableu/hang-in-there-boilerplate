### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This application generates and displays random motivational posters from three collections of data (i.e. images, titles, quotes).  Additionally, user's can enter in custom poster elements and create their own motivational poster.  When users are satisfied with the displayed poster they can save the current poster to a collection of saved posters be viewed later.  If motivation is not what you're looking for, there are also a collection of unmotivational posters to look through and, if necessary, a quick double click will delete any unmotivational poster.  Bonus: Users can double click on any element of the poster in the main view to randomize only that element, until they find the right poster for them.
